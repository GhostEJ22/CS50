                <li>Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes, or EDS, is a group of hereditary connective tissue disorders that causes hypermobility of joints, hyperelastic skin, atrophic scarring, and fragile blood vessels, as well as many other issues.</li>
                <li> This disorder's nature makes it mimic many other conditions, making it a very difficult diagnostic process. Additionally, the most common form of ESD is Hypermobile(hEDS), and the defective protein that causes that type is currently unknown, making that diagnosis even harder to make. It is worth noting that the other 12 types of EDS are known to have a specific defective protein(as will be shown on the History section).
                    <ul>
                        <li>Additionally, depending on the type, EDS may be inherited in either autosomal recessive(both parents have to have it) or an autosomal dominant manner(only one parent has to have it to pass it on).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>There are many different variants of EDS and knowing which one each patient has is very important in determining their treatment(See the Treatment Section).
                    <ul>
                        <li>The major reason that knowing which type of EDS the patient has is important is that there is a vascular type of EDS, which can lead to organ perforation and arterial rupture, which would be life-threatening. There are currently 13 known versions, all complex and with different treatment styles.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
