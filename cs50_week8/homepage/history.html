            <ul>
                <li>As stated previously, and shown to the right, there are many different types of EDS with many different symptoms. <br> With that being said, there are certain symptoms that are necessary for the practitioner to diagnosis this condition.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Telltale signs include hypermobility and skin hyperextensibility(really stretchy skin).</li>
                        <li>EDS has a very large effect on skin, including more than just hyperextensibility, but a velvet-like texture, fragility, slower healing process, and thin scars after healing.</li>
                        <li>A very early sign of EDS is also shoulder dislocations.</li>
                        <li>Children will often also experience a wide variety of other symptoms, including orthostatic intolerance(Sitting upright will cause dizziness and fainting), diarrhea, impaired postural control, pain, and fatigue.</li>
                        <li>Mental development is usually normal.</li>
                        <li>Dentists play a large role in early diagnosis and management, because people often present dentin dysplasia(extreme mobility in the teeth), delayed eruption(teeth popping up late), and hypodontia(Being born without certain teeth) of permanent teeth.</li>
                        <li>The hypermobility causes subluxation and dislocation, leading to chronic pain and osteoarthritis(joint wear and tear). Recurrent fractures are also common.</li>
                        <li>Hernias and rectal prolapse are also common features. Hollow and solid internal organs can also be subject to traumatic and spontaneous perforation or rupture.</li>
                    </ul>
