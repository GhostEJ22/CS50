            <ul>
                <li>Since there are so many types of EDS and there is no cure, there is also no one set treatment that will help everyone. There are multiple types of doctors that are necessary to help get each individual on the right path. With that said, there are certain accepted treatments that will help slow disease progression:
                    <ul>
                        <li>To minimize dislocation and subluxation, people with EDS need to try and limit at-risk activities like weightlifting or contact sports.</li>
                        <li>Cardiovascular screening is very important to mitigate risk factors.</li>
                                <li>To reduce chronic pain people with EDS will need pain medications. Additionally, keeping blood pressure low will reduce the chance of fragile blood vessels being damaged.</li>
                                <li>Hyperextension causes strain on fragile vasculature and causes complications over time, and this risk should be highly monitored and managed. Wearing protective shoes will help prevent ankle sprains. Specifically laced boots with arch support.</li>
                                <li>Resting your jaw will help protect your jaw joint, so don't chew gum, hard rolls, or ice.</li>
                                <li>Sleep is very important, and buying body pillows and dense foam mattresses will provide support for your joints. Side sleeping also helps.</li>
                                <li>Screening for heart abnormalities, like aortic root and mitral valve abnormalities requires echocardiography. If something is found it may require surgery to avoid potential congestive heart failure or complications of rupture.</li>
                                <li>Besides just physical treatments, building a support system and increasing your knowledge of the disease will help you not only understand your disease more but feel less alone.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>IMPORTANT:</b> These are all general treatments, and as stated previously, to help slow the progression as best as possible, the patient must seek professional help from rare disease specialists. The image in the top right is generalized, not specified to each individual, so before doing anything that might put you at risk, talk to a specialist.</li>
                <li>One group of EDS experts is <em>Clinical Paradigms</em>, and if you wish to visit their site, you can click <a href="https://clinicalparadigms.com/">Here.</a></li>
